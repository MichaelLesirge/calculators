Random calculators I have made for math class. They were coded as fast as possible for my TI-84 graphing calcultor to use in math class. 
Each calculator only works for exactly what we were doing that week. 

These are all single file projects so you could copy and paste them into [here](https://www.online-python.com/KlxyAHI74J) for quick running on the browser.
