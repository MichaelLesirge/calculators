# algebraic_expression

This is a python module designed to be used to make other projects.
It allows you to make algebraic expressions with many variables and exponents.
It was made mainly as a fun project and to help me in my math class along with my other random calculators
Hope you find this helpful. There are defently some bugs so don't use if for anything import tho.
